Welcome to the the DragonTravel FAQ textfile.
In this file, some questions about DragonTravel are answered.
Also some random stuff is just written on some places, because
being a server administrator needs more fun and stuff, right?

> Who made DragonTravel?
- Penguins.

> Can you be serious?
- Sure, here you go:

> The dragon sometimes looks into the wrong direction, what can I do?
- This is caused by the client itself, but on clients with more
  FPS, this usually does not occur.

> Economy does not work, I don't get any withdraw.
- As a server administrator, you likely got the permission
  dt.nocost, which disables withdraws for you.
  
> DragonTravel does not work on the server
- If you set "Economy" true in the config but did not install
  the plugin "Vault", then DragonTravel will disable itself 
- If you try to run DragonTravel with an outdated config or
  messages file, then DragonTravel will disable itself
- If you like cakes, then DragonTravel is a lie and disables itself
  
> The dragon flys really glitchy or laggy.
- Decrease the dragon's speed in the configuration
- Set your render distance smaller
- Get better hardware anyways...

> The dragon flys through blocks.
- We can't change that in an efficient way

> Is it possible to remove the boss-health bar?
- No it is not, the boss-health bar is client-sided.

> Where are the permission-nodes?
